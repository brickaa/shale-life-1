    "HED": "About The Shale Life",
    "TEXT": "The U.S. Census Bureau has long pegged Loving County’s population at less than 100, making it one of the country’s emptiest counties. Now, the West Texas community swells with more than 1,000 daily workers.\n \nIn the past five years, South Texas’ La Salle County, population 7,100, has gained some 1,300 residents, thousands of transient laborers and has built at least 20 hotels.\n \nNot long ago, Karnes County, an hour southeast of San Antonio, was home to some of Texas’ poorest communities. But since 2009, the county’s sales tax collections have exploded by a factor of 21, and it has minted dozens — if not hundreds — of new millionaires.\n \nThese types of stories, which Texas Tribune reporters traveled across the state’s shale regions to tell, are becoming common in Texas. That’s thanks to a surge in oil and gas production that has poured billions of dollars into local economies and created hundreds of thousands of jobs, providing lifelines to Texans who had struggled to find work in years past. The industry almost singlehandedly lifted Texas from the country’s last recession.\n \nBut the excitement and opportunities come with challenges and even tragedy: Rent and food prices are skyrocketing in the rapidly growing regions; the water-intensive energy production process is straining scarce resources; oilfield traffic is tearing up roads and killing drivers at high rates; and toxic compounds from drill sites may be making some residents sick. The swift changes have dropped huge responsibilities onto the plates of often-unprepared local officials, who must find solutions to boomtown problems while deciding how to invest new wealth.\n \n“You take what is coming at you and you just hope and pray,” said Ray Kroll, the city development manager in Karnes City.\n  \nSpurred by technological advances like hydraulic fracturing, Texas has reached production numbers unseen in more than three decades. It's pumping more than twice the oil it did three years ago, accounting for more than a third of all domestic production, even as production surges elsewhere in the country. Meanwhile, Texas accounts for about a quarter of all U.S. natural gas production, and the state’s output is the highest it has been since 1975.\n \nWest Texas’ Permian Basin, which first cemented Texas’ reputation as a state rich in fossil fuels, is now home to the most lucrative shale fields in the country. That has breathed new life into towns that rode the boom-and-bust cycles of the past.\n \nSouth Texas is also driving much of the growth. The mad dash to the region’s Eagle Ford Shale has given many communities their first taste of a boom.\n \nBut these booms come with unsettling questions: How long will the bonanza last? And will an eventual drop in oil prices decimate local economies — as has happened throughout Texas’ history?   \n \nEstimates of the boom’s longevity keep getting pushed pack — five years, 10 years, now 25 years. Experts say this boom is different than years' past, thanks to new technology and a more stable global fossil fuels market. “When people look back on this in 20 years, we’ll consider this the golden age,” James LeBas, a tax and fiscal consultant for the Texas Oil and Gas Association, told lawmakers last summer.\n \nBut the growth can’t last forever.\n  \nAfter oil prices plummeted in the 1980s, many folks in West Texas slapped this message onto their car bumpers:  “Please God, Just Give Me One More Oil Boom. I Promise Not to Blow It Next Time.”\n \nThis is their chance."

    "INTRO_TEXT_FARMER": "While many rural communities have eagerly welcomed Texas’ drilling boom, most of Glasscock County’s 1,225 residents would have been happier if the drillers had passed them by.\nCotton farmers in this community east of Midland generally do not own the mineral rights to the land that they farm; many of them sold them off to investors decades ago to help boost their income in the midst of drought. That leaves them powerless to stop energy developers from drilling wells on their property, even as it destroys valuable cropland and cuts into their profits.\nThe shale boom hasn’t been all bad news for these farmers. Some have received one-time payments from energy companies to cover surface damages; others have sold groundwater to drillers. Oil and gas operators now pay the bulk of property taxes in Glasscock County. Yet locals like cotton farmer Dennis Fuchs say those gains do not make up for the spike in traffic, accidents and trash, as well as widespread fears that their quiet community's way of life has been irrevocably changed.

Since 1981, the Southwest Area Regional Transit District, a program funded through state grants, has provided a lifeline for some of those people in nine counties. Three days a week, it runs a special route for those who routinely need dialysis — most of whom are elderly and depend on Medicare.  \nBut the rapid development in the Eagle Ford Shale has created challenges for the service. Crumbling roads hogged by oilfield tankers have increased the cost of maintaining the buses, which see more cracked windshields and torn-up tires. It has also added to the time that patients must wait in traffic, forcing drivers — and the riders — to start their days even earlier.\nTribune reporters hopped aboard a bus route across Dimmit and Zavala counties.

To do his job, Swartz must at times fly as low as 5 feet above ground — and he can't release chemicals around people. These obstacles have complicated his job and at times prevented him from even doing it. ",

That well, Santa Rita No. 1, proved that West Texas held vast petroleum resources, spurring a mad dash to the small railroad community and the surrounding Permian Basin. Because Santa Rita was drilled on University of Texas land, the discovery was also a huge windfall for the state’s universities. \nLike many drilling communities, Big Lake rode the boom-and-bust cycle, and it faded after the 1980s crash. The town and the region have another chance, thanks to advances in hydraulic fracturing that have helped drillers unlock oil and gas once thought to be unreachable. \nThe Permian Basin is now the country’s most productive region. Texas regulators are issuing more than twice the drilling permits there than they did in 2007. It's been lucrative: Between 2009 and 2013, Big Lake's sales tax collections more than doubled, and collections in surrounding Reagan County nearly quadrupled.  \nWhat does Big Lake’s growth really look like?
