Loving County has about 90 people but swells by hundreds each day due to a flood of oil workers. While some complain about the added dust in the air and a spike in accidents, both from the surge in drilling trucks, County Judge Skeet Jones sees the oil boom as a lifeline from extinction.</p><p>He and other local officials are setting the stage for Loving County to welcome new residents and reverse a decades-long decline in population.</p>",
